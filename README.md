# BestBuyWatch
This is a very simple and dirty python 3 script that uses the BestBuy API to scan for products that are in stock.

If or when a product becomes available, the script will pop up your default browser and use the purchase link in the API to put it into the cart for purchase. It will then sleep for 5 minutes to let you purchase. After the 5 minutes, it will keep checking until the end of time (in case you are asleep as well)

The script was quickly assembled for my own use, but a few people over on Reddit wanted to check it out, so community support FTW.
